## Description

This is the webpage i created for our first exam before the summer holiday. We were tasked with creating a blog with a theme of our own choosing. There were several points to be achieved during this project. Firstly we had to create a headless CMS with the blogs to use on our webpage so we can collect the blogs with a API endpoint. The blog had to have a carousel made with html, css and js where you can scroll throught the first blog inserts. It also had to have a collection page and a specific page. All the blogs and its info were to be collected and fetched with the API endpoint.
